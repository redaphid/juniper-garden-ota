# I'm using a lazy way of storing wifi creds for the demo
1. create a file called `wifi-credentials.js` in the `src/` of the project
2. add the following code to the file:
```js
export const ssid = '<your-ssid>'
export const password = '<your-password>'
``

# Warnings!
You may need to run `npm run clean` to fix some issues with the build process.

# Things we have tried
* Using the improv-wifi-mod of Juniper Gardens
 - _note: we noticed that the uuid had to be reversed for the ESP server side to find the BLE device_
 -  _We also stopped commenting out the length check, as using that bleservices json file y'all had was sufficient_
* Using the reference implementation of the improv-wifi from improv-wifi.com
  - `https://improv-wifi.com`
  - _note: this works successfully when flashing over usb, but not over ble_
* Using HomeAssistant's ESPHome in Docker
  - `docker run -p 8123:8123 -v ~/homeassistant:/config`
* Building the ESPHome firmware locally
 `git clone git@github.com:esphome/esphome.git`
* Using platform.io

* I found a cdn with semver! Maybe we can use this to get an earlier version
  https://unpkg.com/esp-web-tools@9.0.4/dist/install-button.js

* improv-wifi.com, inspect element, set debug level to verbose
* Manually implemented the spec and wrote it to the device via a low-level tool

## Things we need to do
- Write the checksum on the packet
- Deal with ssid+password > 20 bytes
